# socket-controller-rdy, an all around Socket IO Backend Controller

This package is a drop-in backend-end controller solution for socket-io managed websocket.
Controller logics are regrouped inside single class, derived from a SocketController abstract class. Each class will run as singleton and several different class can operate at the same runtime. The incoming packets are passed to the corresponding SocketManager controller through the namespace Socket.IO feature. By default, namespace equals to the class name, eg: the class MyController will listen to '/MyController'.

## controller methods logic
The decorator `@ListenTo`, will decorate a Controller method to bind its logic to  socket.io incoming/outgoing events. The decorated function will receive data from the websocket on event with the same name as the decorated function, eg: myMethod will be triggered by 'myMethod' incoming event
The return value of the decorated function will be emited back to ws client on an event of similar name. This return event can be renamed by providing an optional string to the decorator. eg: \@ListenTo('resultEvent'). 

## TypeScript experimental decorators package version
This version of the package makes is compatible with this implementation of decorators which requires each custom controller class to be also decorated (see below).

## Installation

##### client-side : `npm install socket.io-client`
##### server-side : `npm install socket-controller`

## Deployment

### Server-side

The method that are to be bound to incoming WS requests are passed as a trailer argument a direct reference to the underlying socket object if several emits are required.
Methods can be async.
The class that hosts the methods must inherit the `SocketController` **and** be decorated as `@SocketControllerRegister`;
```js
import { SocketController, ListenTo, SocketControllerRegister } from 'socket-controller-rdy';

@SocketControllerRegister
export class MySocketCtrl extends SocketController {
    @ListenTo()
    welcome(data: string) {
        const msg = `The WS controller MySocketCtrl is answering to you!`;
        return msg;
    }

    @ListenTo('reply_here')
    say_hello(data: string, socket:Socket) {
        socket.emit("updateEvent", "step one passed")
        const msg = `The WS controller MySocketCtrl is answering to you too!`;
        return msg;
    }
}
```

We can now create the socket Router which will register the custom controller. It can then be attached to an HTTP server to start handling WS incoming requests.
```js
import {Â createServer } from 'http' 
import { SocketRouter } from "socket-controller-rdy";


const http = createServer();

const router = new SocketRouter();
router.use(MySocketCtrl);
router.bind({ http });

http.listen(8000);
```
The router can alternatively be attached to a pre-existing socket-io server.
```js
const http = createServer();
const io = new Server(http);

const router = new SocketRouter();
router.use(MySocketCtrl);
router.bind({ io });

http.listen(8000);
```

### Client-side
You just need to account for the namespace at connection.

```js
const socket = io("https://server-domain.com/MySocketCtrl");
socket.on("connect", () =>{ 
    socket.emit("welcome", `Hi from Client`);
    socket.emit("say_hello", `Hi from Client too`);
});
socket.on("welcome",(data) => console.log(data)) // prints "The WS controller MySocketCtrl is answering to you!"
socket.on("reply_here",(data) => console.log(data)) // prints "The WS controller MySocketCtrl is answering to you too!"
socket.on("updateEvent",(data) => console.log(data)) // prints "step one passed"
```
